# NixOS Cyberpunk Configuration

A modular, cyberpunk-themed configuration for NixOS with Hyprland, focusing on aesthetics and functionality.

## Overview

This repository contains my personal NixOS configuration with a strong focus on creating a cohesive cyberpunk aesthetic and a fully modular organization. It uses Home Manager for user-specific configurations and flakes for reproducibility.

The system is built around:
- Hyprland as the Wayland compositor
- Rofi with a custom cyberpunk theme
- Helix as the primary editor
- Custom shell configuration with Zsh and Starship
- A developing centralized theme system

## Structure

The configuration is organized as follows:

```
nixos-config/
â”œâ”€â”€ flake.nix                  # Main entry point for configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ configuration.nix          # System-wide configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ home.nix                   # User-specific configuration (Home Manager)
â””â”€â”€ modules/                   # Modular configuration components
    â”œâ”€â”€ development/           # Development environment
    â”œâ”€â”€ editors/               # Editor configurations (Helix)
    â”œâ”€â”€ hyprland/              # Hyprland and window management
    â”œâ”€â”€ rofi/                  # Application launcher
    â”œâ”€â”€ waybar/                # Status bar
    â”œâ”€â”€ yazi/                  # File manager
    â”œâ”€â”€ zellij/                # Terminal multiplexer
    â””â”€â”€ zsh/                   # Shell configuration
```

## Features

### ðŸŽ® Cyberpunk Theme

The configuration features a consistent cyberpunk theme with:
- Deep blue backgrounds (`#091833`)
- Neon cyan accents (`#0abdc6`)
- Neon magenta highlights (`#ea00d9`)
- Clean, modern typography using JetBrainsMono Nerd Font

### ðŸ§© Modular Design

Each component is isolated into its own module for easier:
- Maintenance
- Reuse
- Debugging
- Documentation

### ðŸ’» Development Environment

Optimized for development with:
- Language-specific configurations (Rust, Go)
- LSP integration
- OpenSSL development headers properly configured
- Common development tools

### ðŸš€ Hyprland Configuration

A modern Wayland setup with:
- Efficient keybindings
- Workspace management
- Animation and styling
- Window rules for specific applications

## Current Status

Currently, this configuration implements:
- âœ… Basic system with Hyprland
- âœ… Rofi with cyberpunk theme
- âœ… Waybar integration
- âœ… Helix editor setup
- âœ… Development environment
- âœ… Zsh and Starship configuration
- ðŸ”„ In progress: Centralized theme system

## Roadmap

### Next: Centralized Theme System

I'm currently working on a Tailwind-inspired theme system that will serve as a single source of truth for styling across all applications.

**Key features:**
- Central color definitions with semantic mappings
- Typography system
- Spacing and layout variables
- Consistent styling across all applications

The theme system will be implemented as a NixOS module that other modules can import and use for consistent styling.

### Future: Iconify for Nix

The next major project will be developing an icon management system for NixOS called "nix-iconify."

**Key features:**
- Declarative, reproducible icon management
- Integration with popular applications (Waybar, Rofi, etc.)
- Consistent iconography across different UI toolkits
- Prebundled icons with minimal external API usage
- Cross-distro compatibility

## Installation

This configuration is primarily for personal use and reference, but you can adapt it by:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nixos-config.git
```

2. Modify `configuration.nix` and `hardware-configuration.nix` for your system

3. Rebuild NixOS with your modified configuration:
```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#nixos-framework
```

## Design Philosophy

This configuration is built with several core principles in mind:

1. **Modularity First**: Each component is isolated for better maintainability

2. **Consistency Matters**: Visual and functional consistency across the entire system

3. **Declarative Configuration**: Everything is explicitly defined for reproducibility

4. **Developer-Focused**: Optimized for software development workflows

5. **Aesthetics + Function**: A beautiful system that also enhances productivity
